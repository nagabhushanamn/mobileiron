The benefits using MVC


==> Consistency across applications, which reduces learning time
==> Ease of sharing code between applications
==> Ability to build optimized apps using Sencha's build tools when using MVC


The drawbacks of using MVC

==> Controllers are globally scoped to the application in the Ext JS approach to MVC
       -> which results in additional business logic to grab references to views, models, and other objects

==> Controllers could be written to watch any object at any time, 
    so any given controller might have logic for both view A and view B, 
    leading to additional confusion in large applications.       

==> Unit Testing    

    -> unit testing requires the entire application to be launched in order to test the individual pieces.
